## Introduction

Nowadays we see an increasing development on building technology that directly improve our performance, particularly physical performance. There are already many projects on building exoskeleton mainly with the objective of the army, but we think that there are a lot of uses cases to attach something to our body in a day to day use. One easy example is when we struggling to move heavy things (mainly the old-aged people). Our purpose is to build an exoskeleton arm that’s stronger than a regular human arm, so that those more incapacitated or old people can still be able to perform tasks that require more physical ability. Of course this device can also be helpful to everyone that intends to perform heavy tasks, or works at a factory with big objects.

The arm will be hand crafted with hardware from a local hardware store and will be capable of accommodate a regular adult size arm. We took as inspiration an online project that we provide a link in the “Additional Notes” section. Our focus is to build up on this project, improving it. Our exoskeleton will be attached to the torso and arm compare to only the arm. This will provide extra stability and control when lifting objects. The control will be made by touch sensitive plates and it will be made an attempt to make the arm understand the movement of the arm and providing immediately help and our exoskeleton will be capable of sensing how much weight is lifting and apply the correct force to help the user.

The project main objective is to build an helping tool that is reliable, simple and more affordable than the ones that are available in the market and with focus on civil use, while having the experience of build an actual product from the beginning to end, planning all of the steps by ourselves, a task that unfortunately the university doesn’t teach us. As the project is developed is possible that we will add additional features mainly on the software
side.

## Plan

- First month:
	- Make the schematics of the arm, and buy the material needed to construct them. Start to develop the Arduino Code that will run and control the arm. As the list of material to build the arm is quite large and diverse, we will need time to buy the components.
- Second and third month
	- Start the crafting and building of the arm,
- Fourth and Fifth month
- Integrating all the systems and testing if every component works independently.
- Sixth and Seventh month
	- Fine-tuning performance and test on real work applications.

## Sponsorship Requirements​:

We’d like that the sponsorship with ​ Identity ​ provided us with the financial support to acquire the material needed to build the ​ ArmHack ​. As the project will be developed, it will be easier to choose the correct parts that will be needed, so we’d like that we can buy the material in
3 stages.

For the first stage the material to buy is what we describe, for the second and third stage our plane can change a little bit, but we the base material is close to the one described here. 

For the first stage (beginning of the project), we’ll need:

- Aluminum
	- 3 x 35.5 x 2500mm
	- 2 x 25 x 1000mm
- Hardware Store consumables: Screws and nuts size M4 and M6, Duct tape, Rope.
- Electronics material: Potentiometer, wires and pcb’s.
- Heat shrink tube
- Arduino Nano
- Arduino Uno
- Strain Gauge with Load Cell Amplifier
- FSRs sensor
- Li-Po battery 3S 5500mAh
- VNH2SP30 motor driver
- DC Motor (used an olf one, that used to be used for )

For the construction of the arm we’re pointing to an overall cost of 160€ that we’d like to be sponsored by. 

You can see the 3D design we did beforehand bellow.

## Inspiration

As an extra motivation we would like to show a similar project that we will take as inspiration
and build up on [here](https://hackaday.io/project/20663-affordable-exoskeleton-arm-exoarm
http://www.instructables.com/id/100-Exoskeleton-Arm-ExoArm/) and a recent video showing that this technology is being developed by big companies as being a real solution for the “worker of tomorrow” [here](https://youtu.be/5cvYKWHa2oM).



## In summary

After 7 months of work and always focusing on completing the project within the stipulated period and, above all, within the agreed budget, an achievement of the exoskeleton always had the same caution, so as not to take steps that need to be redone later or spend an excessively high percentage of the budget in one component, then missing for another.

ArmHack presents all the objectives that are proposed, a simple system, robust and reliable that had a construction cost several orders of magnitude lower than what exists on the market for civilian use. Although the system can be improved, the final product can be easily used by anyone, with adjustable fastening systems, has mechanical safeguards that prevent any kind of injury that exoskeleton could cause, preventing it, for example, from extending the elbow joint beyond the that is possible naturally. When using the arm, the user can lift objects up to 16 kg without the need to exert any kind of force on the part of it, just having to hold the object.

The current control system is based on two buttons that activate when activated aesthetic or articulated arm. These buttons can be used both on the auxiliary arm (right) as the opposite arm (left). So, thinking about the applications that the exoskeleton may have a factory or the system will already be able to assist or worker, objective what it was built for.
In addition to the construction of the ArmHack, the Instituto Superior Técnico carried out a conference on the project to be carried out, an initiative and partnership with identity, the current state of technology, and commercialization of the community for the use of exoskeletons in industry.

##  Obtained Objectives

Comparing what was done over the months with what was planned, there was a very sharp discrepancy, this difference was due to the difficulty of building the structure that was not being taken care of when planning. In the initial planning, it was expected that in about 3/4 months the structure would be completed with the rest of the time for the realization of the power system and electronic part of both the control and the human-machine interface. It took 7 months for the construction of the structure and the electronics were developed in parallel from the 6 month to be able to integrate this as soon as the structure was completed.
Thus, the description of the work performed was distributed as follows:

- __First month__: Material ordered, and some used parts already in hand. Cardboard prototype of the exoskeleton, and a (corresponding) 3D digital design.
- __Second month__: Material ordered for the metallic structure all in hand. Small change in 3D digital design. Structure from thorax to forearm developed (the different segments are not assembled together, but simulations have already been made).
- __Third month__: Pulley for the rotation axis at the elbow in hand. Structure of the chest, shoulder and arm finished and functional.
- __Fourth month__: Pulley ready to be implemented in the rest of the structure already developed. Beginning of the programming of the hardware to be used.
- __Fifth month__: Pulley implemented and inserted in the components already developed. 90% forearm structure (already functional). ArmHack's mechanical structure practically finished.
- __Sixth month__: Presentation of the project in a lecture for IST students. Implementation and testing of the electrical system, which has already been programmed for the engine to function. Electrical system still separate from that of the developed exoskeleton structure.
- __Seventh month__: Implementation of the power system and the electronic part in the exoskeleton. Modification of how it is placed on the person, facilitating the process. Improvement of the part of the structure in the area where the engine is placed and electronics. Meeting to present the product to Identity.


## Challenges Surpassed

As described in the previous section, the major challenge encountered in carrying out the project was the construction of the arm structure. Only with rudimentary tools and with access to existing material in construction stores it was necessary to adapt and make almost all of the pieces, not directly finding something that worked directly. From molding the learning how to best use a drill, bench bench and grinder, for all of this it took a learning process, many attempts and the need to redo many of the pieces. However, much of the challenge has passed through here and fun that we had when carrying out the project, being now much more aware of what is a mechanical engineering work that for us, future electrical engineers was totally unknown. It ends up being one of the greatest future assets that ArmHack left us, to realize the difficulties of other areas and how our area of ​​study can help or how cooperation between areas can be improved.

## Conclusion

The development of ArmHack allowed us to develop 3 major aspects. The first, the deepen an area that in the group's conversations we already thought that the future of industrial production, the mechanization of man, allowing him to gain new capacities and work in parallel with machines in parallel. In the research for the lecture we went discovering how this technology can revolutionize the industry, as a robot does not manages, at least immediately, to be better than man in all tasks. Thinking in a cooperative approach it will be possible to increase production and, above all,reduce fatigue and injuries caused by “heavy” jobs still existing in the labor market current job. The second aspect was clearly to have an objective and an open path there arrive only limited by time, tools and budget, approaching a panorama that will be similar to working in companies in real products, versus, in the educational project where we are limited by a statement or by the delimited path by the teacher. Another key aspect was the organization of the group in order to project advance. As it was developed in a garage of one of the elements, there was an effort of the 4 elements so that whenever we worked we were together, so much because everyone had ideas to integrate in the project as if nobody wanted to miss some phase and progress of the exoskeleton. The third aspect was the partnership with Identity and the responsibility it gave coming. While in a school environment the realization of the project usually has personal impact, here we had the possibility to work with a partner / client who investing in the group expects results, results that in the business world are what define the success or failure of projects.

At the level of the exoskeleton, a product base has been achieved that has a lot of potential for be developed and studied. The most difficult step was taken, as from the developed structure many improvements can be implemented as described in the section previous. The arm has an approximate final appearance of the 3D model initially developed and the physical and above all functional fulfillment of it turns out to be the biggest attraction that made the project moving forward.
