Greetings from Portugal, my name is Andr√© Cavalheiro, I am a 22-year-old master's student in AI/ML under the Computer Science division in [Tecnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). I am currently writing my thesis on the usage of _Knowledge Graphs for the smart organization of personal data_ while also working as a junior investigator in [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/).

Here's a list of some of the things I've done during my academic path:

- For two years (2017-2019) I was a member of a university student association known as __[Hackerschool](https://www.facebook.com/hackerschoolist/)__ whose aim is to develop projects under the [maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture)/[DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) philosophies and have a positive impact in the community. I was a developer for most of the time, taking a position in the administrative board in my last semester there.

- During the last year of my bachelor and the beginning of my master's I worked as a web developer (front and back end) in several projects under the Department of Computer Services, __[DSI](https://si.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/)__, of[Tecnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).

- I was part of a team of four members who built a prototype exoskeleton arm, financed by [Identify](https://www.identity.pt/). The project's name was  __ArmHack__, the development took 6 months and you can read about it [here](). 

- I was part of the Portuguese team that got to compete in the finals of the _Tsinghua-Santander World Challenges 2018_. You can read about our project,  __Car Blocks__, [here](). 

- During a semester I Enrolled in the Computer Science course at __Tsinghua university__, Beijing, China. This was part of an MSc exchange program in which I had a scholarship financed by the Chinese government.
