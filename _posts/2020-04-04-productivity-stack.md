_This post is part of the __Stack__ series where I share my main resources related to a certain topic.  This one is dedicated to __Productivity Resources__. I will continue to update this page as I discover more stuff that's worth sharing. Enjoy :) ._


## Frameworks

## Tools

### General.
_Things I use almost every day._
- [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) - This is the crown jewel among my tools. Roam is a note taking app with a pretty cool concept behind it. The thing that really seduced me about is that Roam doesn't force your notes to be thoroughly organized. The strucure forms almost automatically from what you put into it thanks to the bidirectional linking. I won't get into much detail here on how to use Roam but I will say that it's such a powerful tool that you should create some sort of method on how to use it (based on the productivity frameworks you decide to implement) in order to avoid getting lost. 

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - Password managers are programs that store your passwords in an encrypted file behind a master password. _One password to rule them all_. The main advantage of using one is that you can generate random, safe passwords for all the other services you use, relying solely on your ability to remember just one master password. I honestly think having one is essential for everyone's life nowadays. It will keep you safe across the internet and relief you have a huge burden. I use Bitwarden which is has a nice interface, is fully encrypted in the client-side, and has been externally audited.

- [Beeftext](https://beeftext.org/) - This program is exclusive to Windows users, but there are other _text expander_ programs for both Linux and Mac you can look it up. This has great combos with Roam, I should eventually share the snippets I use somewhere in the blog if I ever write an article about Roam.



### Deep Work hacks.
_Tools I use to immerse myself in my work and avoid distractions. I usually activate every one of these things before I begin a working session, you must make a habit out of it or else they won't really have an effect._

- [BlockSite](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/addon/blocksite/) - Firefox Extension to block specific websites whenever it's enabled. I block pretty much every social media app, YouTube, gaming sites and everything that I use to procrastinate. Obviously, I can deactivate this tool whenever I feel like it but seeing the blocked page is usually enough to slap me back to work.

- Zen Mode by One Plus. Zen Mode blocks my cellphone during the time I stipulate it to, with the maximum being one hour. The only thing I'm about to do is emergency calls. This one is specific to my cellphone, but I feel like it's an important one. I imagine there are other apps for Android or IOS that do this as well, so you can just look it up.

- [Pomodoro clock](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-PT/firefox/addon/pomodoro-clock/) - Firefox Extension to help with timing my work/break runs. It's based on the Pomodoro Technique. The timings on the original technique are not ideal for me. I use the ratio of 40 min work / 10 min break, but the app lets you choose whatever ratio you desire.


### Honroable mentions
_Things I've used in the past or have come across but am not using at the moment._
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - Note taking app, way prettier than Roam but with a weaker concept in my opinion. Has a phone app.
- [InstaPaper](https://www.instapaper.com/u) - Safe artciles you find online to read later, all in one place.
