_This post is part of the __Stack__ series where I share my main resources related to a certain topic.  This one is dedicate to __Educational Resources__, most of them about Machine Learning, Network Sciences or overall coding since those my main areas of interest. I will continue to update this page as I discover more stuff that's worth sharing. Enjoy :) ._


- ## Books and Instructive Blogs
- [Network Science book](http://networksciencebook.com/) - Online book to cover theory on network related topics.
- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) - A book that every coder should read and re-read __(Paid)__.
- [Desire to learn (d2l)](http://d2l.ai/) - An interactive deep learning book with code, math, and discussions. (Great to learn theory in an intuitive manner).
- [Lil'Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/)
