_This post is part of the __Stack__ series where I share my main resources related to a certain topic.  This one is dedicated to __Educational Resources__, most of them about Machine Learning, Network Sciences or overall coding since those my main areas of interest. Obviously it would extremly tiresome to share every little thing that I've foud value in, nontheless I will try to continously update this page as I discover more stuff that's worth sharing. Enjoy :) ._


## Books and Instructive Blogs
- [Network Science book](http://networksciencebook.com/) - Online book to cover most of the theory on network-related topics.
- [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) - A book that every coder should read and re-read __(Paid)__.
- [Linux Bible](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Linux+Bible%2C+9th+Edition-p-9781118999875) - Title says it all.  This one has a special place in my heart for kickstarting my journey into computer science. __(Paid)__.
- [Desire to learn (d2l)](http://d2l.ai/) - An interactive deep learning book with code, math, and discussions. (Great to learn theory intuitively).
- [Lil'Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/) - Has a bunch of very interesting articles, mostly reggarding DL.
- [Data Mining Concepts and Techniques](http://myweb.sabanciuniv.edu/rdehkharghani/files/2016/02/The-Morgan-Kaufmann-Series-in-Data-Management-Systems-Jiawei-Han-Micheline-Kamber-Jian-Pei-Data-Mining.-Concepts-and-Techniques-3rd-Edition-Morgan-Kaufmann-2011.pdf) - Cool for everyone who's looking to get into DataScience.

- [MIT Deep Learning Book (Ian Goodfellow)](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf/blob/master/complete-book-pdf/deeplearningbook.pdf) - Deep Learning Fundamentals, heavy on mathematics.
- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Sutton and Barto)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) - The Reinforcement Learning Bible
- CheatSheets for [Artificial Intelligence ](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-221/) [Machine Learning](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/) and [Deep Learning](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/) - Great to learn theory in an intuitive manner

## Articles 
- [The Decade of Deep Learning](https://leogao.dev/2019/12/31/The-Decade-of-Deep-Learning/) - Check the most influencial publications of the decade (2010-2020) in the field of AI.
- [An opinionated guide to ML research](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html) - Tricks and tips for ML research by John Schulman
- [Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)

## Courses
- [Deep Learning principles with Pytorch](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188) - Deep Learning with Pytorch (by Facebook).


## Online Services 
- [Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/) - A platform to find open-source repositories of scientific publications.
- [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com) - Experiment tracking for deep learning. Record and visualize every detail of your research, collaborate easily, advance the state of the art.
- [Google cloud computer vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision)

- [Deep detect](https://www.deepdetect.com/) - Use pre-trained models for a variety of tasks.


## Libraries
### Python
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - This one is kind of a given but I felt like I should still mention it. This is the most important tool to learn if you want to get into DataScience (in my opinion obviously).
- [Thinc](https://thinc.ai/) - A refreshing functional take on deep learning, compatible with your favorite libraries. The first thing to address a ton of problems I used to have about building Machine Learning pipelines.
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - My go-to for deep learning models.
