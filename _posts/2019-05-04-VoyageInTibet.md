## Background

__Cities__: Xian, Lanzhou, Xiahe, Langmusi, Zhangye, Dunhuang

A bit more than a month after my arrival the first major travel happened. I was already starting to get familiar with the university and its workflow. The plan was to visit Xian during the weekend with Helena, Francisco, Min and Iris. Then meet Alex in Lanzhou and spend the following week on the road through Gansu province. 

I met Min and Iris in Helena's birthday only a few days before. They seemed very nice and we talked quite a lot during the dinner., I remember them telling us about the _see you tomorrow mushrooms, that were named like that because suppositely you can see it almost intact the next day after you poop it (lovely). Their real name is Enokitake - 金针菇 （jīnzhēngū) if you wanna check it out. Anyhow, we still didn't knew each other well but they were easy to talk to and gave us great insights and tips! Iris was from Harbin, Heilongjiang, while Ming was from Guanxi province (not exactly sure which city). They both worked alongside Helena.

Me and Alex had a target date for return but it wasn't set on stone. During the trip we had to deliver one assignment for the __Web Information Retrieval__ course and work on another one for __Natural Language Processing__ which was due for around the time we were planning on coming back.

## Into To Xi'an

We left on a Friday (22nd March). The plan was to travel during the night and arrive before lunch. I and Xiq went in a different compartment from the ladies. Our ticket was __Hard Seat__ while theirs were __Hard Sleeper__. We had learned a lot (from João and Alex) about the famous __hard seat__ tickets which were supposed to be pretty shitty. This made Xiq nervous since he has a hard time falling asleep but I was extremely excited. Since my Interrail that these kinds of conditions made me excited. I felt like the adventure I was carving fore was about to truly start, and as time would tell, I was right.

Simply arriving at the train station was already a small achievement. We were supposed to meet the ladies there (which would go directly from the office) while we were leaving from the University. I and Xiq still weren't completely used to riding the metro especially without Helena and especially not during rush hour. To get inside the Wudaokou metro station we had to wait a few minutes in a massive line of people that were waiting to go over the metal detector. We rushed a bit to make sure we wouldn't lose the train.
We eventually met them and from then on out everything went fine. Armed with two Chinese speakers everything was easier. We picked up our tickets, and each group got into their respective carriage.

This is one the interior of the carriage looks like, the picture is not mine but from Google just to have an idea. We were seated in one of the 6-people seats. I remember that in front of us there was a girl that should be a bit older than us and kept silence for most of the voyage, a cute couple that was a bit older (I wanna say mid-40s but not sure) and by our side a really cool guy that was again a bit older than us (I' pretty sure he told us he was around 30, maybe a bit younger).

We didn't speak to pretty much anyone before morning. The guy in his 30s laughed at the way we made instant noodles for dinner since we forgot to cover them after pouring the hot water (we knew we were supposed to but forgot about it, lack of practice I guess). When the nightfall came, everyone started leaving their seats, at first we thought their stop had arrived and they were leaving the train but later we found out that they went to search for empty seats to sleep on. Eventually, only me Xiq and the women were standing. She took control of 3 seats for herself and laid back sleeping. Xiq eventually went to search for empty seats to do the same, I was left alone programming for an assignment. I remember I went to sleep pretty proudly of my work. I also read a bit of the book I had with me at the time __The sense of an ending__. I also read a bit about Xian in the E-book version of __China's Lonely Planet__. That was the first night (of many to come) that we found out about the Chinese lack of love for earphones, randomly throughout the night someone would play a game or watch a video in their cellphone with the audio on max. This was normal during our travels in China but I remember being pretty upset by it during this night. I woke up a couple of times from my sleep to the sound of Chinese soap operas and video games but the night was enjoyable and I was able to sleep pretty well in my three empty seats, I didn't know it at the time but being able to sleep laid down in a hard seat carriage is a lucky feat.

In the morning everyone came back to their seats. The train people open the curtains letting in the light. We talked a bit about our travel buddies. The guy in his 30s was the only one who was able to speak a bit of English so he translated what we said to everyone else and vice-versa. We ended up finding out that he was a programmer, and we high-fived when we figured out we both programmed in JavaScipt. He was going to Xian to meet his girlfriend and complimented us on the habits of reading. The couple was from Gansu, and they were going there right now, Xian was only a midway stop. I told them I was going to Gansu after and they were happy about it, giving me some advice that I fail to remember. They were both calligraphists, or maybe only the man. They all got pretty amazed when they found out we were studying at Tsinghua University. It was a sweet little moment. We were all pretty excited while talking, both us and them. That moment showed me that it was in these types of carriages that the true adventure was in, among the people.

## Xi'an, Shaanxi
Xi'an was one of the many old capitals of China. The city was known for being the eastern end of the silk road and therefore its Arabic influence is felt even to this day. Its main attraction is the __Terracota Army__, a massive collection of hundreds of clay statues that were berried alongside China's first emperor, [Qin Shi Huang](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang), more than two thousand years ago. We decided to leave it for our second (and last) day in the city.

A lady from our hostel was kind enough to come and pick us up from the train station. She had a piece of paper with my name on it, perfectly spelled and with pretty handwriting which I thought was pretty impressive for someone that uses a different alphabet (Most of the time I can't even get the spelling right in my own country!)

We arrived at the hostel, dropped our stuff, asked at the reception for some advice on where to eat and what to see, and head out into the streets. We bought a tofu burger in a street-food stool owned by a cute couple. They were extremely nice and got us plastic stools for us to seat and eat in peace right in the middle of the street. Chinese people always seemed glad for serving foreigners, we would receive shy smiles and proud simple sentences in broken English. Of course, with our two Chinese friends ordering whatever we wanted wasn't a problem, and Min and Iris were always glad to help! We head out to check out the Muslim corner of the city which was famous for having a huge lively market, on the way there we pass through the Bell & Drum towers which were very similar to their twins in Beijing. We even got to visit the Mosque before lunch. I particularly enjoyed seeing the scriptures with both Arabic and Chinese dialects side by side. I and Xiq bought a chess set (one for each) with the Terracota army figures as pieces.

For lunch, we headed in a search for the famous __biang biang noodles__. We had already tasted them back in Beijing in the canteens and supposedly the dish came from Xi'an. We headed for a restaurant that Min found online and ate on the street in small plastic stools while having a lovely conversation. I remember me and Xiq solved some of our doubts regarding Chinese to our newly acquired friends. They also told us that the character for __biang__, is the one with the highest number of strokes in the Chinese language, look at this monster:

During the afternoon we went to see the famous Goose pagoda, ... (temple?) It turns out that Min had recently bought a drone and we got to see it fly for the very first time which was pretty exciting.

By the end of the day, when the natural light started to fade we walked down a street which was having some kind of festival at the time. There were lights, entertainment, and food stools all around. That street, in particular, was providing such happy vibes that we ended up walking for quite a few meters before finally deciding to catch the bus back to the Hostel.

The next day we took the bus to the Terracotta Army location. I and Helena shared headphones and tried to find cool Chinese music on Spotify. I believe it was at that moment that I created my __China sounds__ playlist. Even being a low tourism season the place was packed with Chinese. We were able to pay the student price but I remember thinking the ticket was a bit expensive. The place was huge despite, most of it being dedicated to selling stuff. The Army itself is spread out in 3 pits, one for the common soldiers which has the highest amount of figures, the second for cavalry and infantry units, and the third for the commanding officers. The amount of soldiers greatly decreases as you go from one to another. Despite being a place with a fascinating history, visiting the place shouldn't burden that much hype unless you're a history fanatic. A majority of the figures in the second and third pit are destroyed and hardly comprehensible, some of them without heads. All of them used to have metal weapons but they were stolen throughout the years. To this day they are still working on the site, restoring figures to their former glory and investigating ways to continue to dig the deepest excavation sites without destroying what's inside. It was an interesting place to explore. The museum, in the end, won't be of much interest if you can't read Chinese which unfortunately is our case.

We had lunch there and eventually came back to the city. We were gonna take the train on that very day. We bought a few things for the ride and went back to the Muslim corner to buy a few souvenirs and enjoy the time we had left. We all ate a strawberry ice cream in McDonald's which was fun. I stole an old Chinese coin from a seller in the market that was being a douche bag.
They were all going back to Beijing and I was meeting Alex in Lanzhou. It was the first train I was gonna take alone. When we arrived at the train station there was a massive line of people to get in. Their train was a bit earlier than mine and they had to make a run for it once we got in. Iris, in particular, was super worried about missing the train and head out to a special line when picking up their tickets, total ninja mode. I waited in my own line alongside hundreds of Chinese. Eventually, I Xiq came to where I was and told me that he had had a problem with his ticket. He was forced to stay in Xi'an for another day and head out the Hostel once more. I was able to pick up my ticket and headed outside, found an empty corner, and sat down while programming. I was there for a little less than two hours, most of it only working and eating snacks. Eventually, I got into the train, slept a bit more, ate my noodles, and slept.

## Intro to Gansu

So, there are a few things that I should point out about Gansu province. First of all, despite the fact that this trip was my idea, the amazing itinerary was mostly designed by Alex. At this point he had already been in China for far longer than I had and knew way better where and how to search.
Gansu is a relatively rural province in China. It belongs to the western part of China which means that its railway system is still pretty crappy. Most of the trips between cities happen either by independent drivers who want to earn a few bucks or by bus.  The ones that do happen by train usually take way more time than they should. For us foreigners, figuring out bus timetables is a nightmare and a lot of it relies on faith. I'll leave here a few of the most useful resources (in English) that we used to plan the trip are:
    - [The Land of Snows](https://www.thelandofsnows.com/)
    - [Traveling China](https://www.travelchinaguide.com)
    - Lonely Planet China Guide.
I arrived at the capital of Gansu, Lanzhou, soon after the sunrise. There was a lot of movement already. I met Alex right outside the station. Our main goal was to get to one of the city's bus stations.After spending more than one hour negotiating with shady taxi drivers, and losing a will battle against a Didi driver that didn't want to take foreigners in his car, we eventually got a ride to the bus station. Even after all of that trouble we still got conned. We spent 10min locked inside a minivan without knowing what was going on and went on a huge trip throughout the city with a bunch of strangers... That's the thing with China. The country is pretty safe and you're never in any actual danger but in big cities there are always people trying to take advantage of the fact that you're a complete fish out of the water without being able to properly read, write, or use their online platforms.

That 1h trip was enough to see a bit of Lanzhou. It was filled with mosques everywhere and Chinese people with huge white beards which is something you don't usually see in Beijing.

^^It would be cool to investigate a bit and find out this minority's name.^^

Eventually, we arrived at the bus station and were lucky enough to catch one of the only two buses to Xiahe in that day. Before we knew it we were on our way!

The trip was long enough for us to work for a bit on our assignments and read. The landscape was already starting to look like something entirely different from what I had ever seen. As we got closer and closer to our destination lots of mountains with snowy picks started to pop up in the landscape. Besides the roads herds of [Yaks](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Yaks) filled the land, as well as colorful Buddhist flags. I remember taking lots of pictures through the bus window and being extremely excited about seeing snow and Yaks.

## Xiahe, Gansu

We decided to stay in a home-stay. It was way cheaper and it's a good way of getting to know the culture. The owner was a chill dude. We were the first costumers he had in 2019, even though we were already in March. He said he wasn't as ready as he'd like to be to receive guests but we had no problem with that. There were no showers or any running water by that matter, which meant the flushing mechanism was a bucket.

We had the house all for ourselves and since he didn't actually live there. By the entrance there was a Yak skull hanging on the wall. Later we would learn that these are pretty much everywhere in Tibet. The house had a bar and a library with lots of books about the region. We had lunch there and talked a bit with the owner before going to explore the city.

I should mention that Xiahe a Tibetan city formed around the [Labrang Monastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrang_Monastery). We weren't ready for what we were about to see. So far we could already tell that we were in a really different place from what we had previously seen in China but nothing to the degree of what we were about to see in the Monestary. As we arrived near it, we saw crowds whispering their prayers and walking around the monastery ([clockwise direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumambulation)). The crowd was endless as far as we could see, in it were monks and pilgrims, children and elders, women and men. Everyone could clearly see just by looking at us that we were outsiders. Both our looks and clothing were clear signs. Some of them looked a bit suspicious towards us, others were curious and some of them didn't us any pay attention whatsoever. We started smiling at them and most often than not they would smile back. Warm, big, genuine smiles. 

We basically entered another reality stuck in time where people were immensely dedicated to their religious beliefs. We didn't talk much throughout the day, me and Alex, we just wondered throughout the place. We were in complete awe. 
As we got inside the monastery the amount of monks grew larger. Some of them older, some of them children but all of them with the traditional Buddhist robes stating their position in the hierarchy. We saw wonderful Buddihist paintings, children playing football, groups of monks meditating together, and even got to listen to a monk playing the [Tibetan horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_horn). All over the place and throughout the entire day you could see people praying, whether it was while they circled the monastery, laid out on the ground, or by rotating the [praying wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_wheel). At one point, a few monks even asked us to take a pictures with them, I remember feeling absolutely humbled by it. I remember some of them had IPhones. A monk with an IPhone, now that's something you're not expecting hun?

It was a surreal experience, It just didn't seem real. By the end of the day we looked for the dining hall. We had read online that the monastery provided vegetarian meals for outsiders if you asked. Eating with the monks sounded like an experience we wanted to have. We looked for it for quite a while. Eventually we decided to rest a bit in a corner and fell asleep for almost an hour. Remember that this was the same day we had arrived in Lanzhou on sunrise. When we woke up it was way passed dinner time so we just headed back to town and had dinner in a restaurant. The curious looks from the locals remained active, but just like I said before we smiled at them and they smiled back.

We bought a few groceries before heading out to the house. We worked for a bit in the library. The owner came back a bit after us, he brought a few friends to spend the evening with. He recommended a few books from the library about the Tibetan culture. Alex was the one who jumped right on them super interested to know everything. I remained working for a while more. He occasionally read something out load to clarify some of the doubts we had had during the day. We found out that some monks decide to circle entire mountains as means of  pray and atonement for their bad actions (similarly to rounding the monastery, or rotating praying wheels but in a much bigger scale).
We went to sleep. In our beds eletctric blanks protected us from the cold. We woke up at 6 a.m. and headed out to the bus station. I remember enjoying the light sky of sunrise and the morning breeze. Arriving at the train station we got on the bus to the next Langmusi.
            
## Langmusi, Gansu

So a few things you should know about Langmusi: It's situated in a valley, between two mountains and two monasteries, one in Sichuan and one in Gansu; it's said that, the reason the border is in-between them is because of quarrels between the monasteries. I don't remember if we saw this online or if someone told us. It feels like it's more of a popular saying but maybe there's some truth to it. It's a pretty small town, only 4000 people, and the fact that there's tow monasteries here means that a big portion of its population is really devoted to religion. We found out later that near one of the monasteries there's a mosque! Which adds up to what we had already seen in Lanzhou and represents the religious diversity present in the region.

We slept through most of the trip. The bus driver just parked at a crossroad and everyone got out. No bus stop, no bus sign, no nothing. We were desperate to take a leak after 4 hours with no stops.

Upon exiting the bus we ran to the find some sort of alley and peed against the snow. The village was pretty rural, most of the streets were rudimental. We followed the coordinates to the hostel but the name didn't match with anything we saw. We spent quite a while looking for it. We sent a message to the owners on Wechat and they told us to wait there that they would sent someone. Meanwhile an lady tried to communicate with us, calling us to follow her, we think she was offering to lead us to an hostel since we must have looked confuse but we decided to stay put and wait.

Eventually a man arrived to pick us up. - __Welcome friends. Is this your first time in Tibet?__ - he asked. At that moment I just found it interesting that he chose to say those exact words but they stuck with me. I though about that phrase a lot during the rest of our journey.

We spoke a bit during our way home. He didn't talk much but he offered to explain some stuff to us so we just asked away. 
Turns out we weren't even close to the place where the home-stay so we had to walk for quite a bit. It was a pleasant journey throughout the village, always ascending.

Turns out the man that picked us up was the right-wing of the actual owner. Upon arrival he lead us to the library/reception room where we met the nephew of the owner which was much younger and supposedly the guy that was responsible for running the place. His two sisters, around his age, were also there. He was incredibly nice and communicative, always with a smile on his face. He showed our rooms, and told us to feel at home and come buy the library whenever we wanted.  

Our room was comfy, with a nice few over the village. Once again the beds electric blankets on them. The room's locker was broken but they seemed like trustworthy  people and it ended up not being a problem. There was only one bathroom for everyone. Once again no shower. Calling it a bathroom is kind of overstating it. It was just a small room with a hole in it and toilet paper on the side. A sign that we were deep in the rural areas, it didn't bother us at all, we saw it as part of the experience!
This library was much bigger than the one in Xiahe, with hundreds and hundreds of books written in Tibetan, Chinese and English, lots of great sources of knowledge for travelers.

Once again, time was of the essence and were only staying one night. We payed for our stay and asked for advice on what to see and where to eat. They showed us the backdoor, which had access to kinda of a secret road to one of the town's monasteries and we head out. 
Being above the village meant we had a wonderful view over our surroundings. The mountains that surrounded us were filled with snow and occasional buddhist flags. Monks started popping up as we approached. We were inside in no time after sneaking in through a side door. The vibes we got from the people were pretty similar to the one in Xiahe. Some curious looks but mostly smiles. This monastery was a lot smaller, which was expected proportion of children in this one was higher. Many of them playing around  with each other. We wondered, watching them do their daily shores and praying. Watching  their houses, their art and their temples, the ones we could enter anyway.  
It's kind of impossible not to feel humble in a place like that. It feels like such a simple, yet meaningful existence. A community much different from the ones that we're used to see. Everyone working for each other with, everything on such a simpler, clearer scale. 
We exited the monastery without even knowing following a random path by river side going the opposite direction of the village. It was a very light river that got weaker and weaker as we continued. We eventually understood that we were following a path that the monks used to wonder around. It was desert, only footprints could be seen. The snow started getting thicker and ticker and the river frozen. We adventured ourselves into caves, and walking on ice, drawing snow angels on the snow that by the end covered pretty much all of our lower half. There was complete silent. We were surrounded by nothing but snow and mountains. We stayed for a bit, in silent in taking it all in.
Coming back was a lot faster than going. Mainly because we already knew the optimal paths to avoid obstacles and deep snow. We had lunch in a Hui restaurant  right outside of the monastery and near the mosque. It was literally filled with monks that spent the entire time throwing smiles at us and laughing.

 We checked Baidu maps while we were eating and saw that we were precisely on top of the border between Gansu and Sishuan. We discussed the possibility of changing the course of our trip. We were fascinated with what we saw in the last 2 days. A way of leaving that was straight how of a documentary. We thought about going south and visit other Tibetan villages. We ended up deciding against it.  We knew we would probably come back to this areas with our other friends later in the semester. Furthermore traveling in these areas is already pretty hard as it is, let alone with an improvised plan.

On the afternoon we wondered throughout the village for a bit. We saw the mosque, which was colorful and with an interesting architecture. Eventually we head out the the other monastery which was in the complete opposite side, and way higher. We went uphill for a while before reaching it. The temples in these imposed quite some respect. Huge things, with golden tops and mounts of snow.  We though the view from our room was good but this was something else. I remember we spent quite a long time seating, just watching the view and talking. We ha just met less than a month ago and I think this was one of our first bonding experiences. We discussed our childhoods and our plans for the future. Monks and common folk passed through us praying with the occasional look.
We eventually decided to follow up the only lead we had on finding the spot where [Sky Burials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_burial) were performed. It's a funeral practice were the dead are eaten by vultures in specific places in the mountains. Obviously we weren't expecting to see the actual ceremony, just the place where it occurred. It's becoming rarer and rarer as time passes but according to Wikitravel, the monastery where we were still did it occasionally and it even had the directions on how to find the place, even though they were kind of vague... 

_Go into the gate of Sertri Gompa and follow the road to the left. It eventually becomes a path up through fields to a site with many prayer flags. You can't miss the actual spot where the funerals take place--lots of grisly remains. Photos are not allowed. At one point you will probably go under a fence--just head for the big prayer flags when you see them._

We decided to give it a shot, and got on our way, once again going on the complete opposite direction of the village but this track was much different from the previous one.  It wasn't covered in snow and it was wide open and up the mountain.  We walked for quite a bit, I can't tell you exactly how long but it felt like a bit more than before, the sun was going down and soon it's be dark. We considered going back but we were in too deep to go back now. 

Eventually we saw it. Up a hill and far into the distance a big aggregation of prayer flags. To get there we had to jump a fence, just like the description said, it was a bit of a challenge but we managed. By now we where walking as fast as we could to avoid going back deep into darkness. Approaching the it we could see that it was almost like a small camp, completely made out of flags, tall and colorful. we also started hearing this chants, almost like whispers into the wind. As we got closer and closer we understood that they were actually priers, but there was no one around to cite them... We approached carefully simultaneously fascinated by it and confused by the sounds. Eventually we found the source of the sounds, a loud-speaker connected to a small generated constantly emitting priers... There were no bones or remains or any sights of an actual funeral, only flags, hundreds and hundreds of colorful flags. To this day we're still not 100% sure that we were in the right place even thought it matched the description. We wondered for a bit in silence contemplating.
In a final effort, we climbed the nearest hill just to see if there was anything else around. We didn't found what we were expecting, but we did end up with a wonderful view. There was nothing but snow filled mountains in every direction. We had wondered so far that by now we couldn't even see the village. There was little light by now, and we knew that in a few minutes there wouldn't be nothing but dark. We still stayed for a bit, it was too surreal not to enjoy.

On the way back we had to use the flashlight from our phones for some of the way. I remember the feeling of accomplishment even though we didn't actually found exactly what we went out to find. The day had been absolutely unreal. We arrived at the monastery once again now in complete darkness and descended into the village. We entered the first restaurant that we found open and ate a soup with noodles served by a really funny kid. There was only one final task for the day to be over: To find the way back to the home-stay in complete darkness. Once we left the restaurant we were left with one last surprise. It was snowing. The streets were covered with a thin layer of it and for the first time in my life I had the feeling of snow falling in my face. 

We couldn't find the home stay at first and the guy from earlier even called us to check if everything was OK. We ended up finding it ourselves and they served us hot tea in the library. We told them about our day and chatted for a bit. Later in the evening they offered us bear and a weird candy. They were truly nice, and the library was warmed by a fireplace. We got our computers and worked for a bit on our assignments, listening to Tibetan music. They worked on their own stuff too. It's one of the warmest memories of my time in China. Before going to sleep they told us that if it snowed all night there probably wouldn't be a bus in the morning. That came out to be true. Not even mad, it was a nice place to be stuck in.

In the next day we wondered a bit through town that was now absolutely filled with big piles of snow. The views were amazing from everywhere we passed by and we enjoyed ourselves going back to the places we had been in the previous days. The kids in the Kirti monastery were deep engaged in a snow ball fight which we observed from a far. We engaged in one between ourselves following their example. We got to play a game of chess with a view using my newly acquired chess set from Xian. The guys from the guesthouse taught us how to make a Tibetan breakfast, it reminded us of a natural version of Cerelac, that you made with your hands. During the rest of the day we seized the opportunity to move ahead with our assignments in the library where it was warm and cozy. 

On the following day we said goodbye to our hosts and headed out to the "bus station". We started getting surrounded by tax drivers  claiming that there was no bus, trying to get us to go with them. This wasn't the first time this happened to us, so we politely declined. We waited, waited and waited but the bus never arrived. After talking for a bit we concluded that we couldn't afford to miss another day. We negotiated with the taxi drivers for a bit, until we finally agreed on a price and headed out with them. I remember spending most of the trip searching about the history of Tibet, the role of the Dalai Lamma and the current state of affairs  with China. 
He left us in the (much more official) bus station in the nearby town of Hezuo. There we got into a bus back to Lanzhou where we got the overnight train to Zhangye. Put it all together trip covered 800 Km and took us the entire day. We arrived at Zhangye in the middle of the night.

## Zhangye, Gansu

Our plan was to sleep inside the train station until morning and then head out to Zhangye's National Geopark. We soon realized that it wouldn't be possible. They didn't allow incoming travelers to enter the stations so we got kicked outside. We tried to sleep on some street benches right outside the station but it was too freaking cold and taxi drivers kept pestering us. We discussed our options for a bit. It was way too late to loot for a hostel now and we refused to pay an entire night just a couple hours of sleep.
To get to National Park it was necessary to take a bus. We had searched where the bus station was previously so we decided to get a taxi driver to drive us there and decide what to do next. I remember entering the taxi and instantly falling asleep. It was so warm and comfy that I just wished the trip was as long as possible but before we knew it we were back in the street. We ended up sleeping for a couple hours in the staircase of a building right beside the bus stations where we were somewhat protected from the cold. We took the first bus to the Geopark.

This place, off course, was the Chinese tourism meme. The pictures on the internet were greatly exaggerated and had little to do with reality. It was a low tourism season so we got to see the park without many crowds. There were speakers with epic music everywhere to try and make enhance the experience too much of our laughs. It felt kind of __shallow__ after the wonders we had seen in the Tibetan villages but it was enjoyable nonetheless

Afterward, we headed back into the city, had lunch, and went to see a temple within the city. It reminded me of the Lamma Temple in Beijing. It was home of the __biggest Chinese wooden indoor Reclining Buddha__ although at this point these records feel kind of forced. It was enjoyable, and it had some nice Buddhist art.

To make some time before our night train we found a welcoming coffee shop and worked on our assignments before heading out to the train station.
